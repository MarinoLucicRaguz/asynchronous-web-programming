## Introduction

The goal of this course is to build a strong foundation in asynchronous programming concepts in web development. Through these exercises, students will learn to work with closures, callbacks, promises, streams, and sockets, culminating in setting up an API server with testing and validation.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Syntax Exercises**:
   - Learn and practice the syntax of asynchronous programming, including:
     - Promises
     - `async`/`await`
     - Error handling in asynchronous workflows

2. **Connect 4 Game**:
   - Build a **Connect 4** game, integrating:
     - **Closures**: For encapsulating state and logic.
     - **Callbacks**: For dynamic gameplay interactions.
     - **Async Programming**: To simulate delays or fetch game data.

3. **File Operations**:
   - Read from, manipulate, and write back to text files.
   - Explore asynchronous file I/O operations.

4. **Handling Errors**:
   - Practice identifying, handling, and debugging errors in asynchronous code.
   - Implement robust error-handling strategies.

5. **Working with Streams and Photos**:
   - Learn to process large files efficiently using **streams**.
   - Work with image files for tasks like resizing, converting, or watermarking.

6. **Working with Sockets**:
   - Implement real-time communication using sockets.
   - Create applications that use WebSockets for bi-directional data exchange.

7. **Setting Up the Database and API Server**:
   - Learn to design and set up a **database**.
   - Build an **API server** to interact with the database using asynchronous operations.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add validation to API endpoints.
   - Write test cases to ensure API reliability and correctness.
